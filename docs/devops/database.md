# Database ðŸ§°

We use MongoDB as our database. Currently we use the free tier, but as we get more and more members and projects, we may eventually have to upgrade.

Specifically, we use MongoDB's cloud database service called MongoDB Atlas. We have a RUCOGS organization on Atlas, and we have a rucogs.github.io project. Underneath rucogs.github.io is MainDB, which is our entire database. Note that we only use one database at the moment.


Within the database there are collections

This won't go into depth about how databases work.
